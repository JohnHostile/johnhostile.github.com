<img src="/img/endof2013calendar.jpg" class="centered">

I've been contacted a number of times about the 2014 full year calendar (a calendar I designed and [recommended in 2013 for perspective and productivity](http://johnhostile.github.io/2013-01-20/use-a-full-year-calendar). I still use mine, and I hope a few you out there also found it to be useful. If you're interested, here is the calendar updated for 2014.

 + 8&#189; x 11 pages: [2014-8x11calendar.zip](/files/8x11calendar.zip)
 + 11 x 17 pages: [2014-11x17calendar.zip](/files/11x17calendar.zip)

Go forth and conquer the world this year (and [be sure to let me know about it](https://plus.google.com/+JohnHostile))!
