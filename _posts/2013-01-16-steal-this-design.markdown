title: Steal This Design
---
If you've been on the fence about starting a GitHub pages blog, I encourage you to [rip off my design](https://github.com/JohnHostile/johnhostile.github.com) and start. I tried to make something clean, simple, and easy on the eyes.

If you're not at all familiar with Jekyll, I used these three links to help me get up to speed.
 * [Blogging With Jekyll and Github](http://www.ksornberger.com/blog/blogging-with-jekyll-and-github/)
 * [Blogging with Jekyll and GitHub Pages](http://brianscaturro.com/2012/06/12/blog-with-jekyll-and-github.html)
 * [Google.com](http://www.google.com)

I intentionally kept this design pretty simple, so it should make for a good starting point. Unfortunately, adding things like Disqus comments has complicated things a bit, but that won't stop you. I believe in you.

Here's a [link to the GitHub Repo](https://github.com/JohnHostile/johnhostile.github.com). Make it happen.
